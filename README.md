### 🙃 Why did i Choose QA? </table>
<li>I chose QA because I see it as the perfect combination of critical thinking, technical ability, and the opportunity to play a key role in delivering a high-quality product. I’ve always had a sharp eye for detail, enjoyed identifying issues, and asking the questions others tend to overlook – qualities that align perfectly with software testing.

In addition, QA offers a great entry point into the tech world, even without a deep programming background, while still allowing room for growth into automation, DevOps, or even product management.
I'm currently studying both manual and automation QA, as well as Salesforce testing, with the goal of expanding my skill set and becoming a tester who understands the full picture – from code to user experience.</li>
